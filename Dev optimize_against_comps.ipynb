While the functionality is not included in our combat simulator, Medivacs can also carry a small group of Marines and quickly fly them around the map, making this build useful for harassment in addition to all-out battle."

    "Next we will examine a very annoying Protoss build, called Skytoss since it revolves around lots of air units. The Skytoss builds focus on amassing a large amount of Void Rays and Carriers and is known for being very annoying to deal with due to the high defensive stats, heavy damage, and the general mobility of air units. Due to the high resource cost and build time of the air units, a Skytoss army cannot be built until mid- to late-game. Phoenixes can be used in large battles, but are often used instead for early harassment. Tempests are effective against ground units, but are more useful for providing long ranged aerial bombardment versus buildings and so are typically kept away from the front lines of large battles. A typical Skytoss build has a ratio of 3 Void Rays to 2 Carriers if the opponent is expected to be building a lot of armored units, otherwise the build is almost solely made up of a lot of Carriers."

    "Our next army type to consider is a common Zerg build of Roaches, Ravagers, and Zerglings. Zerglings are the first combat unit the Zerg can produce, with the Roaches and Ravagers being able to be produced shortly after. Zerglings are very fast and cheap making them ideal for early game harassment. While they are individually weak, Zerglings are effective when swarming in large numbers. Roaches and Ravagers are both ranged ground units, with Ravagers having slightly higher damage and lower health. This type of army is typically used very early in the game but is ineffective later in the game if the opponent builds air units. We will be using examining army compositions of Zerglings, Roaches, and Ravagers in a ratio of 4:3:1 and 2:1:1."
