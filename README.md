# StarCraft II AI

The jupyter notebook Counters to Terran Bio Army contains the code and data used to
run our example case optimizing against a specific Terran army composition.
The txt file terran_bio_test contains all 110 initial outputs from running our
example case.

The python files sim_units, viability, simulator, linear_program, and generate_comps
are the core files used to create and run our final program.
The other files and notebooks are either old, unused code or were test environments
used to develop our final code.
